## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Binary Rational Numbers
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-qarith-stern-brocot
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/qarith-stern-brocot.git
cd qarith-stern-brocot
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Documentation

This package contains a rational arithmetic library for Coq.
This includes:

- A binary representation for positive rational numbers `Qpositive` and its
  extension to `Q` by adding sign bit (also known as Stern-Brocot
  tree encoding).
- Arithmetic operations on `Qpositive` and `Q` defined in an strict way.
- More efficient arithmetic operations on `Q` defined lazily using
  homographic and quadratic algorithms for this binary representation
  (exact rational arithmetic).
- Proof of the correctness of the homographic and quadratic algorithms
  using the strict operations.
- The files enable the user to use Coq `field` tactic on `Q` with two
  different field structures (using strict or lazy operations).
- The Haskell extraction of the lazy algorithms (`quadratic.hs`).
- A syntax for using the rational numbers as pair of integers, and writing
  simple arithmetic operations on them.
- A proof of irrationality of the square root of 2.
- A proof that `Q` is Archimedean.
- A proof that `Q` is countable.
