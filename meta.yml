  ## Documentation

  This package contains a rational arithmetic library for Coq.
  This includes:

  - A binary representation for positive rational numbers `Qpositive` and its
    extension to `Q` by adding sign bit (also known as Stern-Brocot
    tree encoding).
  - Arithmetic operations on `Qpositive` and `Q` defined in an strict way.
  - More efficient arithmetic operations on `Q` defined lazily using
    homographic and quadratic algorithms for this binary representation
    (exact rational arithmetic).
  - Proof of the correctness of the homographic and quadratic algorithms
    using the strict operations.
  - The files enable the user to use Coq `field` tactic on `Q` with two
    different field structures (using strict or lazy operations).
  - The Haskell extraction of the lazy algorithms (`quadratic.hs`).
  - A syntax for using the rational numbers as pair of integers, and writing
    simple arithmetic operations on them.
  - A proof of irrationality of the square root of 2.
  - A proof that `Q` is Archimedean.
  - A proof that `Q` is countable.
